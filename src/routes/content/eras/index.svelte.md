# The Era System
The definition of Zeitgeist is the defining spirit or mood of a particular Era reflecting the beliefs and ideas of the time. Our Era system is based on this definition. Each Era is designed to focus on certain areas of the Zeitgeist ecosystem's growth and steer the direction of the Seer Program towards those areas. The length and direction of Eras will always remain fluid as the zeitgeist of the Era develops.  
In the future new Eras will be created that reflect the goals of the Zeitgeist community at that time. Zeitgeist is an evolving platform, and the Seer Program follows that philosophy with the Era system. Designed with the adaptability to allow the greater Zeitgeist community itself to influence the Era.  
Though Eras are meant to direct the flow of creation within the program, and events and tasks will likely reflect that, work and effort outside of an Era's zeitgeist can still be recognized and rewarded.
